download dependencies


WinError 2, couldnt install due to error
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [WinError 2] 
The system cannot find the file specified: 
'c:\\python39\\Scripts\\sqlformat.exe' -> 'c:\\python39\\Scripts\\sqlformat.exe.deleteme'

fixed by changing permissions properties setting for c:/python39 to allow full control

used command pip install django

pip install djangorestframework
pip install django-cors-headers

in project folder
python -m django startproject InventoryAPI

to run server, in project dir
python manage.py runserver

access on local , http://ip:port on browser
python manage.py start app InventoryApp

in settings.py add app dependencies installed_apps:
rest_framework,
corsheaders,
InventoryApp.apps.InventoryappConfig

middle ware dependency added

CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True 

create models for items and category

add db driver for python and mongodb
pip install djongo
pip install dnspython

add mongodb database dependency in settings.py

when making changes to db models:
python manage.py makemigrations InventoryApp
python manage.py migrate InventoryApp

error: Not Implemented Error: Database objects do not implement truth value testing or bool().
The problem is with the new version of pymongo (4.0 from 29.11.2021) which is not supported by Djongo 1.3.6.
You need to install pymongo 3.12.1.

pip install pymongo==3.12.1


added serializer file and corresponding serializer classes to help with data manipulation

added url pattens

from django.conf.urls import url # deprecated
used from django.urls import re_path instead for django 4.0 > 

sql DB decode error fixed
added auto increment to mongodb for categoryid and itemid

https://www.mongodb.com/basics/mongodb-auto-increment

adding barcode in models
https://python.plainenglish.io/generating-barcodes-with-django-52e450fd960b

added folder+static setting urls

https://python.plainenglish.io/generating-barcodes-with-django-52e450fd960b

create react project
npx create-react-app ui

to start ui, go to ui folder and user command:
npm start

npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
npm install react-router-dom


In react-router-dom v6, "Switch" is replaced by routes "Routes". You need to update the import from

import { Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";

to

import { Routes ,Route } from 'react-router-dom';

You also need to update the Route declaration from

<Route path="/" component={Home} />

to

<Route path='/welcome' element={<Home/>} />


make sure react env file is in root of react project, not the src
